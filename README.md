# fastSOS
fastSOS is an app that enables you to access all medical emergency services in a simple and quick way. The current version of the app is just a rough sketch.

Used Tkinter to develop a Desktop App with two modules: 
1. Emergency
- You enter your symptoms and location and the app chooses the nearest hospital and books an ambulance for you
2. General Health
- This allows patients to login using their Unique Health ID and Aadhar number
- It lets users view their current insurance policies and other upcoming ones
- It also shows the balance in their Emergency Welffare Fund
- It also has an option to edit profiles amd settings

Moving forward, we would want to add a location facility by getting real time data and also display dynamic ADs
